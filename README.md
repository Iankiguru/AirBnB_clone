AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT.
This project is a Command Interpreter that provides a user-friendly interface for executing various commands and tasks. It aims to simplify the interaction between users and the underlying system by offering a command-line interface with intuitive commands.
Command Interpreter
The Command Interpreter is a tool that allows users to interact with the system through a command-line interface. It processes user input, interprets commands, and executes corresponding actions. This interpreter supports a wide range of commands, from basic file manipulation to more complex system operations.

How to Start
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd project-name
Install any dependencies or prerequisites, if needed.
Run the command interpreter: python interpreter.py
How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can start entering commands. The basic syntax for a command is:

css
Copy code
command_name [arguments]
Replace command_name with the actual command you want to execute and provide any necessary arguments. Press Enter to execute the command. The interpreter will then process the command and provide output or perform the requested action.
